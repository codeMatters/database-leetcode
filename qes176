SELECT DISTINCT MAX(salary) AS SecondHighestSalary
  FROM Employee a
 WHERE Salary< (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM Employee b WHERE b.salary > a.salary)


-----another way to solve this problem----
select max(salary) as SecondHighestSalary from 
(select dense_rank() over(order by salary desc) as ranks ,salary from employee)e
where ranks=2;
